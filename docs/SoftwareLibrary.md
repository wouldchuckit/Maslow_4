**QUICK START TIP: use Inkscape to draw something with no fill. Export as a regular .svg (not inkscape svg)  Upload that to Krabscam.com build paths for the tools that you have and then Export as a .nc Gcode file which can up uploaded to your Maslow.**

This file is a place to share software recommendations that have been useful. All costs listed are estimates reported by contributors and have not been checked. Good opensource programs are listed first in each category otherwise no particular promotion is intended and all links have been submitted by community members.  

Maslow needs **Gcode** instructions to work.  There are many ways to generate those. Gcode is a human readable programming language that consists of a list of instructions that are sent to a machine to tell it how to move. They are mostly x,y,z coordinates and how to move between them. Instructions include curves, straight lines, and speeds. 3D printers and many other robots use gcode. 

You can open a Gcode file up in a text editor and edit it by hand if you need to.  You could cut parts out.  Only run half of the program, change distances and speeds all by typing in numbers in the Gcode code system.  It is not hard to learn the basics. (insert Gcode library link) 

THere are many many options to get to a sucessful Gcode for Maslow4 Some programs can do all of the steps, some can only do one or two. 


Generally a design will start in a program that lets you draw or specify the shapes for your design. You could use a **2D Vector drawing** program like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator or a **three dimensional program** like Blender or Autodesk. 
Key words for these programs are **Vector drawing or Computer Aided Design CAD** programs. Files can be .**.dxf .svg .stl** but generally not .png or .jpg (bitmap pictures) 


Once you have a mathematcially defined shape, it needs to be translated into Gcode. The programs that can do this are called **Computer Aided Machining or CAM** programs. Examples are Krabzcam on the web, a wonderful and effective 2 dimensional free project. Autodesk and Autocad can do this too. In these programs you would describe the geometry of the router bit that you are using and the type of operation that you would like to do to the wood, like drilling or a profile cut or a shallow pocket cut and then the program designs a pathway for that particular router bit to leave the wood or material behind that you need as it cuts. The resulting file needs to be a **.nc Gcode file**.  


There are many good programs that can do both authoring and generate machine instructions often called **CAD CAM programs**. 


**Abundance** is a CAD CAM sister project of Maslow that aims to make a procedural genrated design program that can then output meaningful Gcode files all in the web. <https://abundance.maslowcnc.com/>  It is being developed now and is already fun and useful. 


We would like to add programs that people feel are useful maybe in weird ways.  For instance Pepkura Designer that is a specialized program for unfolding 3D polygon shapes into flat panels. It was designed for paper models but it is great for wood as well. Three D printers use programs called slicers that cut three dimensional shapes into a stack of 2D slices. Maslow could cut slices in wood or foam to be stacked. What other odd programs have you found useful in generating desgins to cut?

## ALL IN ONE CAD CAM 


### Abundance
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42d79add-c997-4589-9ab5-6154c3f2b6c9" />

- Overview: Abundance is a sister project to Maslow. It is in the process of being developed by many of the same people working on Maslow4.  Abundance is built around the idea of procedural design.  Instead of drawing a table, in abundance you would program a table with variables and parts that could rebuilt and remixed. Leg length, top dimension, lumber size can all be variables that can be changed and the end design would be automatically changed as well. Abundance is being designed to work with Maslow as a free online full CAD CAM program so that you could design and then output cutting Gcode .nc files directly. (written 2025) 
- <https://abundance.maslowcnc.com/>
- Online
- Free 
- Experiences: A very different way of designing. It already can produce complex three d models and is a lot of fun to use. 
- Limitations: Still under development. Not a drawing program, a programming program. 
- Notes:
- - Build parts first as "molecules" then make a new project that puts those molecule pieces together.
- - Boolean operations make it easy to have pieces designed separately intersect and define cutting boundaries as you put them together.

- Overview:FreazyKam is an excellent free online CAM option which can import .svg files or .dxf files and show how they will cut. It was developed in the maslow forums by the community so it is well supported if you encounter any issues

FreazyCAM is a local-first CAM app focused on the essentials:

    Profile cuts
    Pockets
    Drilling
    Automatic tabs
    SVG import and drawing tools
    2D/3D simulation

- Overview: Free Opensource go to program for Vector drawing. Inkscape is the well supported and developed opensource option for Vector drawing. It would be a great tool for designing a engraved sign or for drawing 2d cuts directly. 
- <https://inkscape.org/>
- Download the program and work on your own computer works on PC, Mac, and Linux. Not on phones or tablets. 
- Free Opensource project
- Experiences:
- - Excellent for 2d editing of .svg files
  - Lots of support videos and tutorials on the web.
  - Excellent for free graphic design.
  - For CNC gather the lines that you need to be cut in one operation and change them all to a set color.  Most CAM programs will read each color in a .svg file as a different operation. For instance Drilling can be green while profile cutting could be red.
  - Remember for CNC that we have to have the outside lines of shapes only , any lines in a .svg that are hidden under another piece of the drawing will cut. When finalizing your design be sure to Join all of the shapes together, turn off fill colors and check that the outlines are single, clear and non overlapping. 
- Details:
- Limitations:
- - Only 2 D, no good way to put pieces together in 3 D as you design.

  ### Openscad
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8c8ba29-92c4-46af-ab59-811c792b8e99" />

- OpenSCAD is software for creating solid 3D CAD models. It is free software and available for Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X. Unlike most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender) it does not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects. Thus it might be the application you are looking for when you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts but pretty sure is not what you are looking for when you are more interested in creating computer-animated movies.

OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead it is something like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives you (the designer) full control over the modelling process and enables you to easily change any step in the modelling process or make designs that are defined by configurable parameters.

OpenSCAD provides two main modelling techniques: First there is constructive solid geometry (aka CSG) and second there is extrusion of 2D outlines. Autocad DXF files can be used as the data exchange format for such 2D outlines. In addition to 2D paths for extrusion it is also possible to read design parameters from DXF files. Besides DXF files OpenSCAD can read and create 3D models in the STL and OFF file formats.

## Other useful programs

### GCodeClean
- It’s a CLI tool (runs from a command line) to ‘clean’ 3-axis (XYZ) GCode files.
It will often reduce the file size, the number of GCode lines, and potentially the ‘G0’ travelling times.
It has 3 operations,

    - clean - which does most of the work
    - split - which will split a single GCode file into individual GCode files for each individual cutting path, and
    - merge - which can merge individual GCode files back into one file, and will try to reduce the travelling distance between the cutting paths.

As per the README.md in GitHub
A library and command line utility to do some ‘cleaning’ of a gcode (an .nc, .gcode) file. The primary objective is to be a GCode Linter, as part of that per line linting of gcode is already done.


We also have:

    - eliminating redundant lines (within tolerances),
    - converting very short arcs (G2, G3) to simple lines (G1), also within tolerances,
    - linear to arc deduplication, converting several simple lines to a single arc,
    - eliminate meaningless movement commands - especially G0 without any arguments,
    - correcting G1 to G0 when the z-axis is at a positive value,
    - clipping decimal places on arguments to meaningful values (as per the NIST spec),
    - per line linting: splitting lines to match the actual execution order as per the NIST gcode spec, and then reorganising the ‘words’ on a line to conform to some common practices (but not all),
    - annotate the GCode with explanatory comments (optional), note that annotating a cleaned file means that you may not be able to split the file later,
    - ‘soft’, ‘medium’, ‘hard’ or custom removal of superfluous tokens (minimise).
    - preamble linting: Adding a ‘standard’ set of gcode declarations, i.e. converting the ‘implicit’ to ‘explicit’.
    - postamble linting: Similar to the preamble, but at the end of the file (obviously).
    - file terminator matching: Ensuring that if the file demarcation character % is used at the start of the file then it is also used at the end.
    - splitting of GCode files into individual files, each with a single cutting path.
    - mergeing of previously split files, with some effort at ordering them to reduce the amount of travelling (G0) distance in total.
